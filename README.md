# Movie Wishlists

Welcome to the Movie Wishlists project! This web application allows users to create and manage their own movie wishlists. Users can search for movies by title and add them to their wishlist for future streaming. The application provides a user-friendly interface with three main routes: Landing Page, User Dashboard, and Wishlist.

## Routes

### Landing Page

The Landing Page provides options for users to log in or sign up. Existing users can log in using their credentials, while new users can create an account. Once an account is created, user data is stored in local storage for future logins.

### User Dashboard

The User Dashboard includes a search box where users can search for movies by title or name. Users can add movies to their wishlist for future streaming. Clicking on a movie poster will display the movie details.

There is also an account button that allows users to log out, redirecting them back to the Landing Page.

### Wishlist

The Wishlist page displays the list of movies that the user has added to their wishlist. Users can view and manage their wishlist from this page.
